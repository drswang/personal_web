abstract: The hazards induced by tropical cyclones (TCs), for example, high winds,
  extreme precipitation, and storm tides, are closely related to the TC surface wind
  field. Parametric models for TC surface wind distribution have been widely used
  for hazards and risk analysis due to their simplicity and efficiency in application.
  Here we revisit the parametric modeling of TC wind fields, including the symmetrical
  and asymmetrical components, and its applications in storm tide modeling in the
  North Atlantic. The asymmetrical wind field has been related to TC motion and vertical
  wind shear; however, we find that a simple and empirical background-wind model,
  based solely on a rotation and scaling of the TC motion vector, can largely capture
  the observed surface wind asymmetry. The implicit inclusion of the wind shear effect
  can be understood with the climatological relationship between the general TC motion
  and wind shear directions during hurricane seasons. For the symmetric wind field,
  the widely used Holland wind profile is chosen as a benchmark model, and we find
  that a physics-based complete wind profile model connecting the inner core and outer
  region performs superiorly compared to a wind analysis data set. When used as wind
  forcing for storm tide simulations, the physics-based complete wind profile integrated
  with the background-wind asymmetry model can reproduce the observed storm tides
  with lower errors than the often-used Holland model coupled with a translation-speed-based
  method.

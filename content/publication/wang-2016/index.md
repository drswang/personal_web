abstract: It is challenging to identify metrics that best capture hurricane destructive
  potential and costs. Although it has been found that the sea surface temperature
  and vertical wind shear can both make considerable changes to the hurricane destructive
  potential metrics, it is still unknown which plays a more important role. Here we
  present a new method to reconstruct the historical wind structure of hurricanes
  that allows us, for the first time, to calculate the correlation of damage with
  integrated power dissipation and integrated kinetic energy of all hurricanes at
  landfall since 1988. We find that those metrics, which include the horizontal wind
  structure, rather than just maximum intensity, are much better correlated with the
  hurricane cost. The vertical wind shear over the main development region of hurricanes
  plays a more dominant role than the sea surface temperature in controlling these
  metrics and therefore also ultimately the cost of hurricanes. Â© 2016 IOP Publishing

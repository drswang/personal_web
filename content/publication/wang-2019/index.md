abstract: The impact of dry midlevel air on the outer circulation of tropical cyclones
  is investigated in idealized simulations with and without a moist envelope protecting
  the inner core. It is found that a dry midlevel layer away from the cyclone center
  can broaden the outer primary circulation and thus the overall destructive potential
  at both developing and mature stages. The midlevel outer drying enhances the horizontal
  gradient of latent heating in the rainbands and drives the expansion of the outer
  circulation. The moist convection at large radii is suppressed rapidly after the
  midlevel air is dried in the outer rainbands. An enhanced horizontal gradient of
  latent heating initiates a radial–vertical overturning circulation anomaly in the
  rainbands. This anomalous overturning circulation accelerates the radial inflow
  of the main secondary circulation, increases the angular momentum import, and thus
  increases the cyclone size. The dry air, mixed into the boundary layer from the
  midtroposphere, is “recharged” by high enthalpy fluxes because of the increased
  thermodynamical disequilibrium above the sea surface. This recharge process protects
  the eyewall convection from the environmental dry-air ventilation. The proposed
  mechanism may explain the continuous expansion in the tropical cyclone outer circulation
  after maturity, as found in observations.

abstract: Predicting tropical cyclone structure and evolution remains challenging.
  Particularly, the surface wave interactions with the continental shelf and their
  impact on tropical cyclones have received very little attention. Through a series
  of state-of-the-art high-resolution, fully-coupled ocean-wave and atmosphere-ocean-wave
  experiments, we show here, for the first time, that in presence of continental shelf
  waves can cause substantial cooling of the sea surface. Through whitecapping there
  is a transfer of momentum from the surface which drives deeper vertical mixing.
  It is the waves and not just the wind which become the major driver of stratified
  coastal ocean ahead-of-cyclone cooling. In the fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave
  model a negative feedback is found. The maximum wind speed is weaker and the damaging
  footprint area of hurricane-force winds is reduced by up to 50% due to the strong
  wave induced ocean cooling ahead. Including wave-ocean coupling is important to
  improve land falling tropical cyclone intensity predictions for the highly populated
  and vulnerable coasts.

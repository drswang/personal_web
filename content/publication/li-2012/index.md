abstract: In this paper, a dense sea fog event that occurred over the Yellow Sea (YS)
  on 9 March 2005 is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model
  version 3.1.1 (WRF v3.1.1). It is shown that the WRF can reasonably reproduce the
  main features of this fog case with a newly implemented planetary boundary layer
  (PBL) scheme developed by Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino (MYNN). The low-level jet
  (LLJ) associated with this fog episode played an important role in triggering the
  turbulence. During the fog formation, sea fog extended vertically with the aid of
  turbulence. The mechanical production term resulting from wind shear contributed
  to the generation of the turbulence. WRF simulation results showed that the fog
  layer was thicker in the northeastern part of the YS than that in the southwestern
  part due to the intensity of the inversion layer and the LLJ. The topography test
  in which the mountain region in Fujian Province was removed showed that the roles
  of topography were to prevent the moisture from extending to land, to intensify
  the inversion layer, and to enhance the intensity of LLJ, as well as to elevate
  its altitude.

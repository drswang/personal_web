abstract = {There are simple conceptual models of tropical cyclone intensification and potential intensity. However, such a framework has been lacking to describe the evolution of the outer circulation. An analytic growth model of the tropical cyclone outer size is derived from the angular momentum equation. The growth model fits a full-physics idealized tropical cyclone simulation. The lifecycle composite of the best-track outer size growth shows a strong super-linear nature, which supports an exponential growth as predicted by the growth model. The climatology of outer size growth measured by the radius of gale-force wind in the North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific during the period 2004–2017, can be understood in terms of four growth factors of the model: the initial size, the growth duration, the mean growth latitude, and the mean top-of-boundary-layer effective local inflow angle. All four variables are significantly different between the two basins. The observed lifetime maximum size follows a lognormal distribution, which is in line with the law of the proportionate effect of this exponential growth model. The growth model fits the observed outer size well in global basins. The time constant of the exponential size growth is approximately equal to the product of the Coriolis parameter and the mean effective inflow angle above the boundary layer. Further sensitivity experiments with the growth model suggest that the interannual variability of the global lifetime maximum size is largely driven by the variation of growth duration.},

abstract = {Details of the development of coastal hypoxia in response to the passage of Typhoon Bavi (2020) in the East China Sea were reconstructed by numerical modeling using a three-dimensional coupled physical–biogeochemical model. The model was validated via repeated surveys along a transect across a submerged river valley off the Changjiang Estuary before and after the passage of Typhoon Bavi. Before Bavi's arrival, survey data indicated that the coastal hypoxia had formed off the Changjiang Estuary. However, the hypoxia was not eliminated but instead migrated and aggravated along the observed transect after the typhoon passage. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to the typhoon-induced mixing. Simulation results reveal that the observed development and spatial migration of hypoxia was mainly controlled by typhoon-induced oceanic advection. Results show that Bavi stimulated a regional quasi-barotropic cyclonic loop circulation and coastal downwelling reversing general summer circulation patterns. The onshore transport of the warmer shelf water and subsequent downwelling resulted in a warming of coastal water. The southward coastal current and downwelling induced by the typhoon also led to a migration of the hypoxic zone. Meanwhile, a massive transport of resuspended planktonic detritus from the steep inner shelf and the shallow Changjiang bank toward the submerged river valley occurred. This study reveals that the typhoon-driven currents can play an important role in the development of hypoxia and redistribution of deposited organic matter in coastal shelf seas, which may have both short- and long-term effects on the regional marine biogeochemical environment.},

abstract = {It remains unclear how tropical cyclones (TCs) decay from their ocean lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) to landfall intensity (LI), yet this stage is of fundamental importance governing the socio-economic impact of TCs. Here we show that TCs decay on average by 25% from LMI to LI. A logistic decay model of energy production by ocean enthalpy input and surface dissipation by frictional drag, can physically connect the LMI to LI. The logistic model fits the observed intensity decay as well as an empirically exponential decay does, but with a clear physical foundation. The distance between locations of LMI and TC landfall is found to dominate the variability of the decay from the LMI to LI, whereas environmental conditions are generally less important. A major TC at landfall typically has a very large LMI close to land. The LMI depends on the heating by ocean warming, but the LMI location is also important to future landfall TC intensity changes which are of socio-economic importance.},

abstract = {Abstract. Compound flooding is generated when two or more flood drivers occur simultaneously or in close succession. Multiple drivers can amplify each other and lead to greater impacts than when they occur in isolation. A better understanding of the interdependence between flood drivers will facilitate a more accurate assessment of compound flood risk in the coastal regions. This study employed the Delft3D-Flow Flexible Mesh model to simulate the peak coastal water level, consisting of storm surge, astronomical tide, and the relative sea level rise (RSLR) in Shanghai over 1961–2018. It then applies a copula-based methodology to calculate the joint probability of peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones (TCs) and to calculate the marginal contribution of each driver. The results indicate that the astronomic tide is the leading driver to peak water level, followed by the contribution of storm surge. In a longer term, the RSLR has significantly amplified the peak water level. This framework could be applied to other coastal cities which face the similar constraint of unavailable water level records.},

abstract = {The hazards induced by tropical cyclones (TCs), for example, high winds, extreme precipitation, and storm tides, are closely related to the TC surface wind field. Parametric models for TC surface wind distribution have been widely used for hazards and risk analysis due to their simplicity and efficiency in application. Here we revisit the parametric modeling of TC wind fields, including the symmetrical and asymmetrical components, and its applications in storm tide modeling in the North Atlantic. The asymmetrical wind field has been related to TC motion and vertical wind shear; however, we find that a simple and empirical background-wind model, based solely on a rotation and scaling of the TC motion vector, can largely capture the observed surface wind asymmetry. The implicit inclusion of the wind shear effect can be understood with the climatological relationship between the general TC motion and wind shear directions during hurricane seasons. For the symmetric wind field, the widely used Holland wind profile is chosen as a benchmark model, and we find that a physics-based complete wind profile model connecting the inner core and outer region performs superiorly compared to a wind analysis data set. When used as wind forcing for storm tide simulations, the physics-based complete wind profile integrated with the background-wind asymmetry model can reproduce the observed storm tides with lower errors than the often-used Holland model coupled with a translation-speed-based method.},

abstract = {In this study, the relationship between tropical cyclone (TC) intensity and rain rate over the ocean is investigated using a full-physics numerical model (WRF) and a physics-based TC rainfall model (TCR). TC intensity is found to be nearly linearly correlated with the average rain rate in the inner core ($\sim$ 0.97 (mm × h −1 × m −2 )/(m × s −1 )), while the correlation is weak at outer radii. This difference is induced because TC intensity is significantly correlated with both the vertical velocity and specific humidity in the inner core but is not significantly correlated with the vertical velocity in outer radii. Further investigation shows that the intensity-rain rate relationship at outer radii is influenced by the evolution stage of TCs. Outer radii rain rate is positively correlated with TC intensity for non-decaying TCs, while this correlation is reduced for decaying TCs due to systematic downdrafts in the outer radii. In the context of climate change, sensitivity of TC rain rate to sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be +9% per K increase of SST, roughly the product of the sensitivity of TC intensity to SST (+3%) and the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling (+7%). Coupled with synthetic storms, evolutions of TC rain rate over the 21 st century under the SSP5 8.5 scenario are projected by the TCR (calibrated with the WRF simulations). The annual increase rates of averaged TC rain rate are 0.17% and 0.20% for inner core and outer radii, respectively, larger than the annual increase rate of TC intensity (0.046%) but comparable to that of cube of intensity (0.18%).},

We investigated the change in global tropical cyclone activity in coastal regions over the period 1982–2018. We found that the distance of tropical cyclone maximum intensity to land has decreased by about 30 kilometers per decade, and that the annual frequency of global tropical cyclones increases with proximity to land by about two additional cyclones per decade. Trend analysis reveals a robust migration of tropical cyclone activity toward coasts, concurrent with poleward migration of cyclone locations as well as a statistically significant westward shift. This zonal shift of tropical cyclone tracks may be mainly driven by global zonal changes in environmental steering flow.},

We find a globally enhanced local cold wake amplitude 3 days after the LMI of − 0.12 ± 0.04 °C per decade whereas the cold wake size does not show any significant change. Multivariate regression models based on the observed ocean cooling, the TC translation speed and the ocean mixed layer depth are applied to infer LMI and TC size. The inferred annual mean global LMI has increased by 1.0 ± 0.7 m s −1 per decade. This inferred trend is between that found for two directly observed data sets. However, the TC size and the TC destructive potential measured by the integrated kinetic energy, have not altered significantly. This analysis provides new independent and indirect evidence of recent TC LMI increases, but a stable size and integrated kinetic energy.},

abstract = {Climate change leads to sea level rise worldwide, as well as increases in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs). Storm surge induced by TC's, together with spring tides, threatens to cause failure of flood defenses, resulting in massive flooding in low-lying coastal areas. However, limited research has been done on the combined effects of the increasing intensity of TCs and sea level rise on the characteristics of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes. This paper investigates the spatial variation of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes subject to past and future TC climatology and sea level rise, via a case study of a low-lying deltaic city- Shanghai, China. Using a hydrodynamic model and a spectral wave model, storm tide and wave parameters were calculated as input for an empirical model of overtopping discharge rate. The results show that the change of storm climatology together with relative sea level rise (RSLR) largely exacerbates the coastal hazard for Shanghai in the future, in which RSLR is likely to have a larger effect than the TC climatology change on future coastal flooding in Shanghai. In addition, the coastal flood hazard will increase to a large extent in terms of the flood water volume for each corresponding given return period. The approach developed in this paper can also be utilized to investigate future flood risk for other low-lying coastal regions.},

Through a modeling study we show that, while the maximum wind speed is rapidly restored after the TC passes a warm- or cold- (eddy size) sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, the storm size changes are more significant and persistent. The radius of gale force winds and integrated kinetic energy (IKE) can change by more than 10% per degree and this endures several days after crossing an SST anomaly. These properties have a long memory of the impact from the ocean fluxes and depend on the integrated history of SST exposure. They are found to be directly proportional to the storm total precipitation. Accurate continuous forecast of the SST along the track may therefore be of central importance to improving predictions of size and IKE, while instantaneous local SST near the TC core is more important for the forecast of maximum wind speed.},

abstract = {The impact of dry midlevel air on the outer circulation of tropical cyclones is investigated in idealized simulations with and without a moist envelope protecting the inner core. It is found that a dry midlevel layer away from the cyclone center can broaden the outer primary circulation and thus the overall destructive potential at both developing and mature stages. The midlevel outer drying enhances the horizontal gradient of latent heating in the rainbands and drives the expansion of the outer circulation. The moist convection at large radii is suppressed rapidly after the midlevel air is dried in the outer rainbands. An enhanced horizontal gradient of latent heating initiates a radial–vertical overturning circulation anomaly in the rainbands. This anomalous overturning circulation accelerates the radial inflow of the main secondary circulation, increases the angular momentum import, and thus increases the cyclone size. The dry air, mixed into the boundary layer from the midtroposphere, is “recharged” by high enthalpy fluxes because of the increased thermodynamical disequilibrium above the sea surface. This recharge process protects the eyewall convection from the environmental dry-air ventilation. The proposed mechanism may explain the continuous expansion in the tropical cyclone outer circulation after maturity, as found in observations.},

abstract = {The characteristics of tropical cyclone intensity and size during the mature stage are presented. Rooted in the classic description by Herbert Riehl, the mature stage is identified as the period from the time of lifetime maximum intensity to the time of lifetime maximum size. This study is the first to analyse the global climatology of the mature stage of tropical cyclones in detail. Three basic features at the mature stage are observed: the reduction of intensity, the outward expansion of the eyewall, and the increase of tangential wind in the outer primary circulation. Globally, about a quarter of tropical cyclones undergo the mature stage. High intensity at the end of the immature stage favours the likelihood of the occurrence of the mature stage. The intensity reduction during the mature stage is considerable with nearly three-quarters of cyclones decreasing by more than 10%, which makes the conventional 'steady-state' presumption questionable. The increase in the radius of damaging-force wind is typically about 50 km, while the decrease in maximum wind speed is typically 20% at the mature stage. However, the average integrated kinetic energy and hence destructive potential increases substantially by about 70%. This is consistent with our finding that most of the highly damaging landfalling hurricanes undergo a mature stage. Intensity downgrades during the mature stage may be misinterpreted as they are mostly not accompanied by an overall danger reduction.},

Particularly, the surface wave interactions with the continental shelf and their impact on tropical cyclones have received very little attention. Through a series of state-of-the-art high-resolution, fully-coupled ocean-wave and atmosphere-ocean-wave experiments, we show here, for the first time, that in presence of continental shelf waves can cause substantial cooling of the sea surface. Through whitecapping there is a transfer of momentum from the surface which drives deeper vertical mixing. It is the waves and not just the wind which become the major driver of stratified coastal ocean ahead-of-cyclone cooling. In the fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave model a negative feedback is found. The maximum wind speed is weaker and the damaging footprint area of hurricane-force winds is reduced by up to 50% due to the strong wave induced ocean cooling ahead. Including wave-ocean coupling is important to improve land falling tropical cyclone intensity predictions for the highly populated and vulnerable coasts.},

abstract = {9 It has been challenging to project the tropical cyclone intensity, structure and destructive 10 potential changes in a warming climate. Here we compare the sensitivities of tropical cyclone 11 intensity, size and destructive potential to sea-surface warming with and without a pre-storm 12 atmospheric adjustment to an idealised state of Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE). 13 Without RCE, we find large responses of tropical cyclone intensity, size and destructive 14 potential to sea surface temperature changes, which is in line with some previous studies. 15 However, in an environment under RCE, the tropical cyclone size is almost insensitive to sea 16 surface temperature changes, and the sensitivity of intensity is also much reduced to 3-4% o C -17 1 . Without the pre-storm RCE adjustment, the mean destructive potential during the mature 18 stage increases by about 25% o C -1 . However, in an environment under RCE, the sensitivity of 19 destructive potential to sea-surface warming is only about 3-4% o C -1 . Further analyses show 20 that the reduced response of tropical cyclone intensity and size to sea-surface warming under 21 RCE can be explained by the reduced thermodynamic disequilibrium between the air 22 boundary layer and the sea surface due to the RCE adjustment.

abstract = {It is challenging to identify metrics that best capture hurricane destructive potential and costs. Although it has been found that the sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear can both make considerable changes to the hurricane destructive potential metrics, it is still unknown which plays a more important role. Here we present a new method to reconstruct the historical wind structure of hurricanes that allows us, for the first time, to calculate the correlation of damage with integrated power dissipation and integrated kinetic energy of all hurricanes at landfall since 1988. We find that those metrics, which include the horizontal wind structure, rather than just maximum intensity, are much better correlated with the hurricane cost. The vertical wind shear over the main development region of hurricanes plays a more dominant role than the sea surface temperature in controlling these metrics and therefore also ultimately the cost of hurricanes. {\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, almost all available observational data and the latest 6.0 version of Regional Atmospheric Modeling Sys-tem (RAMS) model were employed to investigate a heavy sea fog event occurring over the Yellow Sea from 2 to 5 May 2009. The evolutionary process of this event was documented by using Multifunctional Transport Satellites-1 (MTSAT-1) visible satellite im-agery. The synoptic situation, sounding profiles at two selected stations were analyzed. The difference between the air temperature and sea surface temperature during the sea fog event over the entire sea region was also analyzed. In order to better understand this event, an RAMS modeling with a 15 km×15 km resolution was performed. The model successfully reproduced the main characteris-tics of this sea fog event. The simulated height of fog top and the area of lower atmospheric visibility derived from the RAMS mod-eling results showed good agreement with the sea fog area identified from the satellite imagery. Examinations of both observational data and RAMS modeling results suggested that advection cooling seemed to play an important role in the formation of this sea fog event.},

abstract = {In this paper, a dense sea fog event that occurred over the Yellow Sea (YS) on 9 March 2005 is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model version 3.1.1 (WRF v3.1.1). It is shown that the WRF can reasonably reproduce the main features of this fog case with a newly implemented planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme developed by Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino (MYNN). The low-level jet (LLJ) associated with this fog episode played an important role in triggering the turbulence. During the fog formation, sea fog extended vertically with the aid of turbulence. The mechanical production term resulting from wind shear contributed to the generation of the turbulence. WRF simulation results showed that the fog layer was thicker in the northeastern part of the YS than that in the southwestern part due to the intensity of the inversion layer and the LLJ. The topography test in which the mountain region in Fujian Province was removed showed that the roles of topography were to prevent the moisture from extending to land, to intensify the inversion layer, and to enhance the intensity of LLJ, as well as to elevate its altitude.},

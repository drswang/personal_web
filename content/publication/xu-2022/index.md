abstract: Abstract. Compound flooding is generated when two or more flood drivers
  occur simultaneously or in close succession. Multiple drivers can amplify each other
  and lead to greater impacts than when they occur in isolation. A better understanding
  of the interdependence between flood drivers will facilitate a more accurate assessment
  of compound flood risk in the coastal regions. This study employed the Delft3D-Flow
  Flexible Mesh model to simulate the peak coastal water level, consisting of storm
  surge, astronomical tide, and the relative sea level rise (RSLR) in Shanghai over
  1961â€“2018. It then applies a copula-based methodology to calculate the joint probability
  of peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones (TCs) and to
  calculate the marginal contribution of each driver. The results indicate that the
  astronomic tide is the leading driver to peak water level, followed by the contribution
  of storm surge. In a longer term, the RSLR has significantly amplified the peak
  water level. This framework could be applied to other coastal cities which face
  the similar constraint of unavailable water level records.

abstract: "The characteristics of tropical cyclone intensity and size during the mature\
  \ stage are presented. Rooted in the classic description by Herbert Riehl, the mature\
  \ stage is identified as the period from the time of lifetime maximum intensity\
  \ to the time of lifetime maximum size. This study is the first to analyse the global\
  \ climatology of the mature stage of tropical cyclones in detail. Three basic features\
  \ at the mature stage are observed: the reduction of intensity, the outward expansion\
  \ of the eyewall, and the increase of tangential wind in the outer primary circulation.\
  \ Globally, about a quarter of tropical cyclones undergo the mature stage. High\
  \ intensity at the end of the immature stage favours the likelihood of the occurrence\
  \ of the mature stage. The intensity reduction during the mature stage is considerable\
  \ with nearly three-quarters of cyclones decreasing by more than 10%, which makes\
  \ the conventional 'steady-state' presumption questionable. The increase in the\
  \ radius of damaging-force wind is typically about 50 km, while the decrease in\
  \ maximum wind speed is typically 20% at the mature stage. However, the average\
  \ integrated kinetic energy and hence destructive potential increases substantially\
  \ by about 70%. This is consistent with our finding that most of the highly damaging\
  \ landfalling hurricanes undergo a mature stage. Intensity downgrades during the\
  \ mature stage may be misinterpreted as they are mostly not accompanied by an overall\
  \ danger reduction."

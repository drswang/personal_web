abstract: 'There are simple conceptual models of tropical cyclone intensification
  and potential intensity. However, such a framework has been lacking to describe
  the evolution of the outer circulation. An analytic growth model of the tropical
  cyclone outer size is derived from the angular momentum equation. The growth model
  fits a full-physics idealized tropical cyclone simulation. The lifecycle composite
  of the best-track outer size growth shows a strong super-linear nature, which supports
  an exponential growth as predicted by the growth model. The climatology of outer
  size growth measured by the radius of gale-force wind in the North Atlantic and
  Eastern Pacific during the period 2004â€“2017, can be understood in terms of four
  growth factors of the model: the initial size, the growth duration, the mean growth
  latitude, and the mean top-of-boundary-layer effective local inflow angle. All four
  variables are significantly different between the two basins. The observed lifetime
  maximum size follows a lognormal distribution, which is in line with the law of
  the proportionate effect of this exponential growth model. The growth model fits
  the observed outer size well in global basins. The time constant of the exponential
  size growth is approximately equal to the product of the Coriolis parameter and
  the mean effective inflow angle above the boundary layer. Further sensitivity experiments
  with the growth model suggest that the interannual variability of the global lifetime
  maximum size is largely driven by the variation of growth duration.'

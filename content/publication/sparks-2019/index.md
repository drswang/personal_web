abstract: There have been no high-frequency aircraft observations of tropical cyclone
  (TC) eyewall boundary layer turbulence since two flights into Atlantic hurricanes
  in the 1980s. We present an analysis of the first TC boundary layer flight observations
  in the South China Sea by the Hong Kong Observatory comprising four eyewall penetrations.
  We derive the vertical flux of momentum and vertical momentum diffusivity from observed
  turbulence parameters. We observe negative (upward) vertical fluxes of tangential
  momentum near the eyewall consistent with a jet below the flight level near the
  radius of maximum wind. Our observations of vertical momentum diffusivity support
  a superlinear relationship between diffusivity and wind speed at the high wind speeds
  in the inner-core of TCs (power-law exponent of 1.73 Â± 0.20) while the few existing
  boundary layer hurricane observations in the North Atlantic suggest a more linear
  relationship.

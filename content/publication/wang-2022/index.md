abstract: It remains unclear how tropical cyclones (TCs) decay from their ocean lifetime
  maximum intensity (LMI) to landfall intensity (LI), yet this stage is of fundamental
  importance governing the socio-economic impact of TCs. Here we show that TCs decay
  on average by 25% from LMI to LI. A logistic decay model of energy production by
  ocean enthalpy input and surface dissipation by frictional drag, can physically
  connect the LMI to LI. The logistic model fits the observed intensity decay as well
  as an empirically exponential decay does, but with a clear physical foundation.
  The distance between locations of LMI and TC landfall is found to dominate the variability
  of the decay from the LMI to LI, whereas environmental conditions are generally
  less important. A major TC at landfall typically has a very large LMI close to land.
  The LMI depends on the heating by ocean warming, but the LMI location is also important
  to future landfall TC intensity changes which are of socio-economic importance.

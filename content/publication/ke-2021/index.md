abstract: Climate change leads to sea level rise worldwide, as well as increases in
  the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs). Storm surge induced by TC's,
  together with spring tides, threatens to cause failure of flood defenses, resulting
  in massive flooding in low-lying coastal areas. However, limited research has been
  done on the combined effects of the increasing intensity of TCs and sea level rise
  on the characteristics of coastal flooding due to the failure of sea dikes. This
  paper investigates the spatial variation of coastal flooding due to the failure
  of sea dikes subject to past and future TC climatology and sea level rise, via a
  case study of a low-lying deltaic city- Shanghai, China. Using a hydrodynamic model
  and a spectral wave model, storm tide and wave parameters were calculated as input
  for an empirical model of overtopping discharge rate. The results show that the
  change of storm climatology together with relative sea level rise (RSLR) largely
  exacerbates the coastal hazard for Shanghai in the future, in which RSLR is likely
  to have a larger effect than the TC climatology change on future coastal flooding
  in Shanghai. In addition, the coastal flood hazard will increase to a large extent
  in terms of the flood water volume for each corresponding given return period. The
  approach developed in this paper can also be utilized to investigate future flood
  risk for other low-lying coastal regions.

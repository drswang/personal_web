abstract: In this paper, almost all available observational data and the latest 6.0
  version of Regional Atmospheric Modeling Sys-tem (RAMS) model were employed to investigate
  a heavy sea fog event occurring over the Yellow Sea from 2 to 5 May 2009. The evolutionary
  process of this event was documented by using Multifunctional Transport Satellites-1
  (MTSAT-1) visible satellite im-agery. The synoptic situation, sounding profiles
  at two selected stations were analyzed. The difference between the air temperature
  and sea surface temperature during the sea fog event over the entire sea region
  was also analyzed. In order to better understand this event, an RAMS modeling with
  a 15 km√ó15 km resolution was performed. The model successfully reproduced the main
  characteris-tics of this sea fog event. The simulated height of fog top and the
  area of lower atmospheric visibility derived from the RAMS mod-eling results showed
  good agreement with the sea fog area identified from the satellite imagery. Examinations
  of both observational data and RAMS modeling results suggested that advection cooling
  seemed to play an important role in the formation of this sea fog event.

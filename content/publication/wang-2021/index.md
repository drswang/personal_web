abstract: Poleward migrations of tropical cyclones have been observed globally, but
  their impact on coastal areas remains unclear. We investigated the change in global
  tropical cyclone activity in coastal regions over the period 1982â€“2018. We found
  that the distance of tropical cyclone maximum intensity to land has decreased by
  about 30 kilometers per decade, and that the annual frequency of global tropical
  cyclones increases with proximity to land by about two additional cyclones per decade.
  Trend analysis reveals a robust migration of tropical cyclone activity toward coasts,
  concurrent with poleward migration of cyclone locations as well as a statistically
  significant westward shift. This zonal shift of tropical cyclone tracks may be mainly
  driven by global zonal changes in environmental steering flow.
